########## Overview
#
# This file is designed to translate a firing sequence to ! (bang) code and send it to the poofer controller boards.
# 
# It expects to be passed to it the following data structures:
#	pooferMappings 	- an object containing the poofer control board address (board number and channel) of each poofer (see notes below for its expected format)
# 	disabledPoofers - list of poofers that are currently disabled
# 	firingSequence 	- list of poofer firing sequence events (see notes below for its expected format)
#
# If it fails to correctly carry out the events in firingSequence, it will return 1. 
# Successful firing will return 0.
#

#
########## Structure of firingSequence
# firingSequence 
# Poofers are named by location:  which plink they're on, and then which location they're in within their plink.
# The names of the plink and poofer locations are: north, south, east, west, top, and bottom.
# Poofers can be fired in sequence or in parallel. Parallel-fired poofers will technically fire in a 
# sequence but there will be no rest time in the bang code, giving the best visual appearance possible of 
# these firing events happening in parallel. Sequentially-fired poofers will have a rest time between them 
# to give the visual appearance of a sequential event. See parameters section for this rest time.
#
# firingSequence is a string list of the form:
# {ABxxxx&ABxxxx,RRxxxx,ABxxxx,etc}
#
# where: 
#	A is the position of the poofer, which can be T, B, N, S, E, W
# 	B is the position of the poofer on its plink, it can be T, B, N, S, E, W
# 	RR indicates that there should be a rest for time xxxxx
# 	xxxx is the time duration of the firing, in milliseconds (max value is 3500, as defined by poofer control board firmware)
# 	& separates firing events that should happen in parallel
# 	, separates firing events that should happen in sequence 
#
# Therefore each string element is a firing step, and one step can contain several poofers to be fired in parallel.
# Note that xxxx must always be a 4 digit number, so there must be leading zeros for millisecond values < 1000, i.e. 0100
#
# Example: 
# To define a firing sequence where poofers in the N-S axis fire rapidly (100ms poofs) in sequence from the outside in,
# with both N and S sides firing from the outside in at the same time, we would write:
# {NN0100&SS0100,NT0100&ST0100,TN0100&TS0100,TT0100}
#
########## Bang Protocol
#
# The bang protocol defines the form of the code used to command the poofer controller boards.
# Bang protocol defined here: http://flg.waywardengineer.com/index.php?title=Bang_(!)_Protocol

'''
poofer sequence - let's define it as:
pooferid, on time, delaytime
[{"id":"NW", duration:1000, "startTime":1200} That's an event. So a sequence is 
{"name":<name>, [{"id":"NW" etc... Let's use the tool to generate these.
That's an event object. Not as easily human understandable, but it works
